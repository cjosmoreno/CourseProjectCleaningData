The variables come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. This data was provided 
in Coursera.
This variables has a lot of statistics measures like: means, standard deviation, max, min, curtosis, etc
The firts transformation, in order to clean the data, was to merge both training and test data set
After that, it was a matter of renaming o labeling in a god way the variables
I did not a special transformation on variables, just merge the data and rename it according the text information
To merge data it was helpful dplyr package
to get the tidy data in a correct way th efunction write.table was essential
The units of the variables are the
